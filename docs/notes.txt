**** Notes about the tasks to be done ****
++	There is a need for an error middleware on the backend to better improve the messages sent to the client, also I need to add an ApiException class to handle business logic errors in the app.
+	About page
+	RosterScale table was made to create a cache-like table for roster-scale grades, but it is a work
	in progress still, although an effective way to stop storing Scales X Comments on the Grade table would
	be a better solution, taking into consideration the possibility to remove comments and updating the
	grades per roster.
++	Look for Campus functionality
+   Notifications functionality (front, backend, and table)
+       If I delete the userId from localstorage and decide to add/vote then a userId is generated automatically on the backend, make sure that
        that new id is being assinged correctly on the frontend to the user.
+       Show a better validation for the comment-grade form.
+       Show the default value for the sorting type on the comment's page.
+	There is a bug on the teacher's name when the screen is decreased, name and lastname overlaps.
