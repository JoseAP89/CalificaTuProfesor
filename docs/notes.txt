**** Notes about the tasks to be done ****

+ 	Build the About page
+   Build the rust code for detecting vulgar words and gibberish and execute it with WASM
++	There is a need for an error middleware on the backend to better improve the messages sent to the client,
	also I need to add an ApiException class to handle business logic errors in the app.
+	Add a diagram to show how the services interact with each other on the docker network.
+	About page
+	Add a badge comments filter by UniversityArea-StudyField on the Roster Page, that would be a great
	and useful addition.
+	RosterScale table was made to create a cache-like table for roster-scale grades, but it is a work
	in progress still, although an effective way to stop storing Scales X Comments on the Grade table would
	be a better solution, taking into consideration the possibility to remove comments and updating the
	grades per roster.
+	There is a bug when you first select the campus, when creating a teacher, and then you select it, you
	always get a not recognized campus first, which it is resolved by re selecting it.
++	Build a logger
+   Notifications functionality (front, backend, and table)
+   If I delete the userId from localstorage and decide to add/vote then a userId is generated automatically on the backend, make sure that
    that new id is being assinged correctly on the frontend to the user.
+   Show a better validation for the comment-grade form.
+   Show the default value for the sorting type on the comment's page.
+   Change Roster table name to Teacher, it is no longer a roster but a simple teacher table,
	an all the modifications that that name change will entail
++ Change compose.yaml to remove the jaavscript file executed post-start
