**** Notes about the tasks to be done ****
+       Add a Common Repository.
+	It was added the upvote and downvote functionality, currently every comment brings the list of votes it has on the
	system, is there a better way without bringing all that info for every comment??  [03/09/2023]
+	There is a need for an error middleware on the backend to better improve the messages sent to the client, also I need to add an ApiException class to handle business logic errors in the app.
+	About page
+	Look for Campus functionality
+   Notifications functionality (front, backend, and table)
+       If I delete the userId from localstorage and decide to add/vote then        a userId is generated automatically on the backend, make sure that
        that new id is being assinged correctly on the frontend to the user.
