**** Notes about the tasks to be done ****

+   build a http error listener service for the front end to show useful info to the user
++	There is a need for an error middleware on the backend to better improve the messages sent to the client,
	also I need to add an ApiException class to handle business logic errors in the app.
+	Add a diagram to show how the services interact with each other on the docker network.
+	Delete RosterScale table
+   Notifications functionality (front, backend, and table)
+   Change Roster table name to Teacher, it is no longer a roster but a simple teacher table,
	an all the modifications that that name change will entail
++  Change compose.yaml to remove the jaavscript file executed post-start and serve the
	rust server
.	Only thing remaining is over time add words to the black_word_list and the white_word_list,
	thus, it would be an always active task (ALWAYS ACTIVE)
