**** Notes about the tasks to be done ****
+       Add a Common Repository.
+	There is a need for an error middleware on the backend to better improve the messages sent to the client, also I need to add an ApiException class to handle business logic errors in the app.
+	About page
+	Look for Campus functionality
+   Notifications functionality (front, backend, and table)
+       If I delete the userId from localstorage and decide to add/vote then a userId is generated automatically on the backend, make sure that
        that new id is being assinged correctly on the frontend to the user.
+       Show a better validation for the comment-grade form.
+       Show the default value for the sorting type on the comment's page.
